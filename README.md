Python String Processor
Project List :
Create a class that will accept input in either a string or a list type, if it’s a list then call another function in the class to check they’re all strings (if not, return an error)

Create another function inside the class which can output the list as a file, and finally create an append function that will allow you to append to the list. Once complete you will have a function that accepts and appends lists on demand but only of the str type.

Add additional checks to ensure they’re ASCII-compliant (eg no #%$%^ allowed)
